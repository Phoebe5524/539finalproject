                <p>Duration:March-June, 2021</p><br/>
                <p>Nowadays, although the scale of Jingdezhen's ceramic industry is expandingconstantly, the proportion of hand-made art
                    ceramics is still very low, and the number of individual business of hand-made ceramics is decreasing. So the skills and culture of
                    hand-made ceramics are facing the fault of inheritance. With the consideration of production conditions of Yuyao Ceramic Kiln,
                    natural conditions and current layout, in order to arouse the awareness of the importance and protection of hand-made ceramic
                    technology, several design strategies were put forward to help create an immersive hand-made ceramic technology and cultural 
                    interaction environment.</p>

                <p>The ancient town of Yangliuqing, located on the outskirts of Tianjin, has a complex population
                    composition, as do the sprawling fringes of many big cities. The migrants from the villages, towns
                    and metropolis converge here, forming a rich and diverse life style and cultural background. Both
                    urban and rural style will coexist here. One the one hand, the prosperous but crowded city and the
                    picturesque but poor countryside are the memories and pursuits of different groups of people,
                    the moon here and the sixpence there; on the other hand, they can make up for the hidden loss of
                    farming area while realizing the modernization of life style.</p>

                <p>Individual Work</p><br/>
                <p>Duration:April-December, 2020</p><br/>
                <p>The project is a new student centre located in Nanjing Forestry University. The new student spaces were intended to relieve
                    pressure from overcrowding in the school library, stimulate the creativity of students, and work to create a larger student
                    social and study precinct at the heart of the campus by connecting students with one another in a dynamic and inspiring
                    setting.</p><br/>
                <p>With the reserved pond in the central of the site, the atrium space is designed for connecting the students to the nature.
                    The stepped roof garden gives students access to the second floor. The functions include sports, community activities and
                    study.</p>

                <p>Duration:September, 2019- February, 2020</p><br/>
                <p>The site is located on the side of Yangtze River flowing through Nanjing, and is a rare riverside beach oasis in high density
                    city.</p>
                <p>This project is intended to be a site for nature education, bird watching, fishing, hiking, and quiet contemplation by keeping
                    the tidal flat wetland environment as far as possible, setting up pedestrian corridor, and increasing the wetland experience
                    space for citizens; and hundreds of wildlife species populate here.Using the self-purification capacity of water body and
                    ecological filtration of greenland, the water can finally become safe and accessible to the public. At the same time, with
                    wetlands and different types of revetments, the problems of waterlogging in rainy season and drought in dry season can be
                    solved, and the average allocation of water can be realized.</p>
